# fractal-eye-analyses
## Overview
This is a project for analyzing the fractal structure of infants eye-gaze. 

## Data
Sample eye-tracking data collected from the same infant, at different ages. Data were collected using a Tobii eye tracker (300 Hz)

## Processing
Folder contains Matlab code for processing eye-gaze data.

## MFDFA
Folder contains code adapted from: Espen Ihlen (2020). Multifractal detrended fluctuation analyses (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38262-multifractal-detrended-fluctuation-analyses), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved January 29, 2020.  
Check out the code -- this should work for any time series.

## analysis
R code for modelling age-related change in Hurst-exponent.
